# 🍰 bake
a string manipulation playground for developers

> [!WARNING]
> bake is currently in development and not ready for usage yet

## about
bake is heavily inspired by [IvanMathy/Boop](https://github.com/IvanMathy/Boop) 
and aims to be compatible with the Boop scripts and API. the goal 
is to add a handful of quality-of-life features (mainly tabs lol) 
on top of Boop's current functionality and also to establish a 
base that is easy to extend and build on top of.

> bake me a String as fast as you can!
